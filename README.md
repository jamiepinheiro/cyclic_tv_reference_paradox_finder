# Cyclic Tv Reference Paradox Finder

_Cyclic TV Reference Paradoxes_ occur when a chain of fictional
TV show references form a cycle. Each showâ€™s reality depends on
another being fictional, so a cycle of these dependencies is a
paradox.

> Here, in the Simpsons' fictional universe, Rick and Morty exists as a TV show (shown by the reference). However, in the Rick and Morty fictional universe, The Simpsons also exists as a TV show. These two references create a cycle where each depends on the other being fictional in their respective universe, which cannot both be true simultaneously - a paradox!

This project finds these paradoxes through looking through subtitles files of popular TV shows. It is divided into two sections:

## Reference Gen Scripts

A set of python scripts to get the subtitles, and eventually output a CSV file of all TV show references found to be displayed in a web app.

| Script                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| get_top_tv_show_subtitles.py | Downloads subtitles of the top TV shows listed on [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Be sure to set the `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.                                   |
| index_srts.py                | Indexes all subtitle files downloaded by `get_top_tv_show_subtitles.py` with [Woosh](https://github.com/mchaput/whoosh).                                                                                 |
| search_subtitles.py          | Searches the index generated by `index_srts.py` for a keyword.                                                                                                                                           |
| gen_output_data.py           | Generates a graph of TV show references from the index generated by `index_srts.py` (and saves it to disk). Outputs a CSV of all references found in the index above as well a CSV of all TV shows used. |
| find_cycles_in_references.py | Runs a DFS on the graph outputted in `gen_output_data.py` to find cycles in references.                                                                                                                  |

## Web App

A react web app for visualizing the the graph generated by the _Reference Gen Scripts_. Run with `npm run start` to test locally.
